## 📌 What Is Nutrition Agent?

**Nutrition Agent** is an intelligent virtual assistant that helps you eat better, smarter, and more personally.  
Whether you're diabetic, gluten-sensitive, vegetarian, or trying to lose weight — this AI *knows* your plate.

Built using **IBM Watsonx**, **Granite LLMs**, and **Agent Builder**, it crafts meal plans based on your health conditions, lifestyle, fitness goals, cultural preferences, and even real-time feedback.

## 💡 Why This Matters

Most diet apps are boring and generic. They can’t explain *why* something is better.  
Nutrition Agent gives you **contextual, expert-level food advice** — in plain English, or even from a photo.
